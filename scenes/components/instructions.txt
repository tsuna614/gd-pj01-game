1. What each Component does:
	- HitComponent: Acts as hitbox for the attacker's hit (sword's slash, axe's chop,...)
	- HurtComponent: Acts as hitbox for the one being attacked
	- DamageComponent: 

2. About Components' Error Message:

You'll see the error message in the Components (Area2D),
which is "This node has no shape, so it can't collide or
interact with other objects. Consider adding..."

However, we don't add a CollisionShape2D or anything similiar
as a child, because we want these Components to be reusable
and customizable for multiple objects. (1:38:05)
